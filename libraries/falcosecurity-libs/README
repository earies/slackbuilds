Falcosecurity Libraries contain libsinsp, libscap, the kernel module and
the eBPF probes sources.

This component stack mainly operates on syscall events. We monitor
syscalls using either a kernel module or an eBPF probe, which we call
drivers. On top of the drivers, libscap manages the data capture
process, while libsinsp enriches the data, and provides a rich set of
API to consume the data. Furthermore, these two libraries also implement
a plugin framework that extends this stack to potentially any other data
sources.
