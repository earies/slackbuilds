Thrift is a serialization and RPC framework for service communication.
Thrift enables these features in all major languages, and there is
strong support for C++, Python, Hack, and Java. Most services at
Facebook are written using Thrift for RPC, and some storage systems use
Thrift for serializing records on disk.

Facebook Thrift is not a distribution of Apache Thrift. This is an
evolved internal branch of Thrift that Facebook re-released to open
source community in February 2014. Facebook Thrift was originally
released closely tracking Apache Thrift but is now evolving in new
directions. In particular, the compiler was rewritten from scratch and
the new implementation features a fully asynchronous Thrift server.
